# Hello world

Hi, thanks for using this app! It's a joy to know that my app can be useful to someone.

## Why this project ?

This application was created to help people who feel bad to get better. The idea came from an advice given by a friend when I was
feeling bad. She told me to write down every night three things that made me smile during the day. After doing this for about two
months, I decided to create this application to help people apply this advice. It also served as my first project to learn how to code 
applications for the general public.

## What is this app doing ?

Every day, you'll receive a notification to remind you to write down the things that made you smile. Only one notification per day is 
sent. (you can disable them in the settings). When you enter information in the fields provided, the content is saved in a file of your 
own on your phone. Nothing is sent to anyone. Everything happens on your phone, in private. When you open the Diary, the file is opened
 and displayed in a convenient way.
