# flutter_application_1

A simple flutter project

## Why this project ?

This project is made to help me learn to code applications using flutter.

## What is this app doing ?

A friend of mine ones said than, writing the good things that happend in your day would actualy help to feel better. So I made this little app to do exactly this. You can write anything you want into this. It will be saved into a file on your phone, wich will never be shared to me. Everything is yours. Its like a secret garden.
